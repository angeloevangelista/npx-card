# Hi, Angelo here!

<div align="center" height="500">
  <img
      align="left"
      title="Coding"
      src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angeloevangelista/angeloevangelista/master/.github/images/rounded-coding.gif" 
      style="
        width: 120px;
        height: 120px;
      "
    />
</div>

This is my NPX card to connect with me directly via console or terminal

## How to use it

Just go to your terminal and run that:

```sh
npx @angeloevangelista/card
```

I will not show how to install it globally. You know, it would be a kind of weird 🧐

This project was based on this [amazing project](https://github.com/carinebatista/npx_card#readme) from [Carine Batista](https://github.com/carinebatista). Thanks for the inspiration 💜.
